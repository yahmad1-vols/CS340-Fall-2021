## Project Selection or Proposal

Our proposed application will be an idle game similar to Cookie Clicker where over time you earn some sort of currency to buy different tiers of objects to make more money. Our application will use Twitter API to tweet success about the game, but we will also use a weather API to change the weather in game to be the same as your weather in real life. This will also affect how much you make in game based on the items you buy. For example, when it is sunny and not windy in your area, your solar panels will make more money while wind turbines will not make as much and so on. This means that our application will have features including but not limited to:

* Idle game (ex. Cookie Clicker)
* Progression through multiple tiers of the game
* Achievements
* Connection to Twitter API to share game progress
* Connection to weather API to change in game weather to real time weather based on location
* Clean and easy to use game UI
